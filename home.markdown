Hi! It's Lana here. I am a self-taught photographer in Melbourne. I tend to prefer portrait photography and model tests, but also happy to capture family memories or do maternity photo shoots.

Photography is a great personal project for me; through photos, I can share all the beauty I see everyday in everyone. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have to collaborate with me.

Natural, true photos of every person who wants to capture something important. It is all about you, your life, your age, your day, your smile; it is all about being brave, beautiful, empowered, free and happy. Donâ€™t afraid of being yourself.
