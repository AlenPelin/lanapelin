<p>Hi! It’s Lana here. I am a self-taught photographer in Melbourne. I tend to prefer portrait photography and model tests, but also happy to capture family memories or do maternity photo shoots.</p>

<p>Photography is a great personal project for me; through photos, I can share all the beauty I see everyday in everyone. Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have to collaborate with me.</p>

<p>Natural, true photos of every person who wants to capture something important. It is all about you, your life, your age, your day, your smile; it is all about being brave, beautiful, empowered, free and happy. Don’t afraid of being yourself.</p>
